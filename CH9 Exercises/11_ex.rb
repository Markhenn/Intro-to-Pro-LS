I liked the rails API very much (https://api.rubyonrails.org/). It was easily accessible, though I didnt understand much. It was easy to see, that there was a searchbar on the top right and underneath where all the important parts of rails in a tree. Opnening the tree opened more options for each part. Again I just saw a couple of familiar things like an array or a hash. 

Clicking the familiar array opened a page that show array methods. What I really liked, was that it showed all methods nicely organized alphabeticcaly at the top. Which made me comfortable to get a glimbse of all methods that there are availlable. 

Again I dont know (yet) what most of these methods mean, but I feel they are better presented than the standard API library or the core library. Here i tend to use the search because it feels quicker than trying to locate the things in the sidebar.
